Here you will find in full display the "unique" programming skills of a group of young, hot, depressed (at times) coding students who are just trying to make it in this beautiful tech world. Our group motto is "What you see is what you get...", because thats all that we can pretty much do at the moment... ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115671262/202943106-3f48f799-0f65-49b4-90e3-f38ee6bc3f9e.png)


Please enjoy but be mindful and dont send too many resume request at the moment. 
We cant get to so many in our busy busy codingLyfe (see how i camel that? #skills). 


Thank you in advance!
